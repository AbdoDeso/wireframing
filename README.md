### Key Elements in the Wireframe

**1. Layout Structure**  
Defines the overall arrangement of page elements such as headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.  
Example: A grid-based layout ensures visual hierarchy and consistency across pages, improving usability.

**2. Navigation**  
Includes menus, links, buttons, and breadcrumbs that guide users through the interface.  
Example: A clear top navigation bar helps users quickly find sections like Home, Services, or Contact.

**3. Content Placement**  
Determines where text, images, and media will be positioned to support user engagement and readability.  
Example: Placing key call-to-action buttons above the fold increases visibility and user interaction.

**4. Functionality**  
Highlights interactive components like forms, search bars, filters, and dynamic elements.  
Example: A visible search box with auto-suggestions improves user experience by speeding up information retrieval.
